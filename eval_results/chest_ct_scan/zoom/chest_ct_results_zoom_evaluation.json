Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that arises from the squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells that make up the outer layer of the skin and the lining of some internal organs.\n\n2. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of cancers that originate in the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system.\n\n3. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a type of cancer that arises from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) system and the nervous system.\n\n4. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in glandular cells, which are cells that produce and secrete substances such as mucus, enzymes, or hormones.\n\nEach type of cancer has its own unique characteristics, treatment options, and prognosis. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate course of action for each individual case.",

Adenocarcinoma: This is the most common type of lung cancer, originating in the glandular cells of the lung tissue. It is often associated with smoking and can be found in the periphery of the lung.\n\n2. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. In this case, the lymphoma is located in the right lower lobe of the lung.\n\n3. Small cell lung carcinoma: This is a rare and aggressive type of lung cancer that originates in the small cells of the lung tissue. It is often associated with smoking and can be found in the central part of the lung.\n\n4. Squamous cell carcinoma: This type of lung cancer arises from the squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells that line the airways and the outer surface of the lung. It is often associated with long-term exposure to radon gas and can be found in the periphery of the lung.\n\nPlease note that the image is a CT scan of the chest, which helps visualize the different types of lung cancer in the patient.",

In stage IIb, the cancer has spread to distant organs, but it has not yet reached the lymph nodes.\n\nStage III: This stage is further divided into three sub-stages: IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc.
